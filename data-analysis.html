                            2018 NYC Central Park<br>Squirrel Census
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            I've analyzed data from the
                            <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-29"></a>2018 NYC Squirrel Census.
                            I've cleaned, formatted, organized, and sorted the data using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/#">Pandas</a>, and made
                            all of the graphs using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/index.html">MatPlotLib</a>.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <img class="chart" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 20%;" src="images/squirrels/squirrel_pic.jpg" alt="Image of a squirrel.">
                </div>

                <div class="child">
                    <img class="chart" src="images/squirrels/location.png" alt="">

                    <p style="margin-left: 10%;">
                        In recording the sightings, census takers noted the precise latitude and longitude the squirrels were spotted at
                        (or perhaps rather where the observer was located). This is a heatmap of that data, or more specifically, a 2D-histogram.
                        Brighter regions of course indicate that there were many spottings in a close vicinity to the location, and darker indicate 
                        there were few or none. I think it's fascinating that just from a handful of squirrel spottings, we can clearly make out
                        where the lakes and buildings are, as no squirrels can be spotted there.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="child">
                    <img class="chart" src="images/squirrels/sightings.png" alt="">

                    <p>
                        A simple bar plot of the number of recorder sightings over the month the census took place. Interesting to note that
                        on the 13th, over 400 sightings were recorded!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="child">
                    <img class="chart" src="images/squirrels/trees.png" alt="">

                    <p>
                        Here I've made a scatterplot of the latitude and longitude of all squirrel sightings in which the census taker included
                        the words "tree" in their extra notes (including variants like "trees", "Tree", etc.). It's not particularly interesting 
                        for this particular dataset, as it communicates relatively the same information as the heatmap, but with different animals 
                        or different study area, or a much larger data set, filtering notes like this could be more informative as it could show us 
                        how tree density relates to where the animal spends its time, locational preference, or just help to understand the arragement
                        and density of different flora.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="child">
                    <img class="chart" src="images/squirrels/colours.png" alt="">

                    <p>
                        Census takers also recorded the primary and highlight fur colors of the squirrels they spotted. Here are some pie charts
                        showing relative proportions.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="child">
                    <img class="chart" id="foo4" src="images/squirrels/heights.png" alt="">

                    <p>
                        Another take on the latitude/longitude plot, but this time a scatterplot where the data points are colored according to
                        the height the squirrel was spotted at. It's not really for picking out invidivual spotting heights, but rather to see
                        a heightmap of the landscape, showing us where the tallest trees (presumably) are, and also making obvious that the vast 
                        vast majority of squirrels were spotted on the ground or very close.

            I've always found statistics interesting and I enjoy making graphs and mathematical models, as well as just organizing things
            in general. My general interest combined with the fact that I'll be studying 
            <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-NABIF/18010">bioinformatics at Lund University</a> in the fall has inaugurated
            my learning of data analysis. I have begun self-taught but may still take courses online before the school semester starts. In any case,
            I'll be putting projects I do on display here as I go forward.
