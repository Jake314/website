    <div class="block">
        <p>
            I've coded this website entirely myself, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have taken a
            course in web design, but most of what I know is self-taught. I also have experience with <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>
            as I used it to design a website for the startup I was a part of. I manage the website using <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.

    <div class="webdes-container">
        <p class="rotate-cw">HTML</p>
        <p class="language-explanation">
            HTML is the language in which the content of a webpage is written. Every word, image, button, list, and link is contained in the
            HTML of the website. The characterizing feature of HTML is the tags surrounding every element. &lta&gt and &lt&#47a&gt, for example,
            tells the website whatever's in between will be a hyperlink to another webpage. &lth1&gt indicates a header, &ltem&gt
            will make text italic, and so on. HTML also includes meta-data that search engines care about, like the fact this website
            is a portfolio or it's written in English.
            <br><br>
            HTML starts to get more interesting when you include the &lt&#47div&gt tag, classes and id's. These three things allow you to label
            elements or group them together to let you reference them in CSS and JavaScript.
        </p>

    <div class="webdes-container">
        <p class="rotate-cw">CSS</p>
        <p class="language-explanation">
            Once you have all of the content of a webpage, the next step is making it look a certain way. CSS is how one can change stylistic
            elements like colours, borders, empty space, opacity, size, and more. CSS is much more powerful than just colouring some text, though.
            It can also be used to change style on actions like hover or click, leading to animations like the one when this text appeared. There
            are some really interesting capabilities, but probably one of the simplest but hardest things CSS is used for is rearranging and
            rescaling everything so the website looks good no matter what size screen it's displayed on.

    <div class="webdes-container">
        <p class="rotate-cw">JavaScript</p>
        <p class="language-explanation">
            At the end of the day, there's only so much functionality CSS can give to a website. If one wants more control over the functionality
            of a website, JavaScript is the answer. It can also control simple things like changing style, and animating things, but can also
            bring much more complex functionality like interactive elements or real-time updating of information.
