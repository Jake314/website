    <h1 class="title">About me</h1>
    <p id="about-text" class="block">
        Hey! My name is Jake and I'm a 22 year old Canadian citizen currently living in Sweden. I graduated in 2023 with an HBSc in 
        mathematics and a minor in physics from Lakehead University and am planning on pursuing a Master's in bioinformatics and
        data science at Lund University. I've always been passionate about math and science, especially when it comes to abstract ideas
        and learning to link and apply these abstractions. For most of my life I've mainly been interested in pure math and physics but
        I've recently taken a strong interest in machine learning and data analysis.  Throughout my life I've had many periods of being
        fascinated by different subjects, jumping from math and science to philosophy and linguistics, all the way to dance and photography.
        I've always had a deep interest in music too though, as I've played saxophone and a smattering of other wind instruments for 
        several years. In my free time I like to go rock climbing or play video or board games with my friends, and while I'm no
        extraordinary chef, I do enjoy cooking and baking.
